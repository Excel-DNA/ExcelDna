// General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the value or you can default the Revision and Build Numbers

//
// In order to sign your assembly you must specify a key to use. Refer to the
// Microsoft CLR Framework documentation for more information on assembly signing.
//
// You can use the attributes below to control which key is used for signing.
// You can also use the project property page for signing under Common Properties
// to set the same information.
//
// Notes:
//   (*) If no key is specified, the assembly is not signed.
//   (*) KeyName refers to a key that has been installed in the Crypto Service
//       Provider (CSP) on your machine. KeyFile refers to a file which contains
//       a key.
//   (*) If the KeyFile and the KeyName values are both specified, the
//       following processing occurs:
//       (1) If the KeyName can be found in the CSP, that key is used.
//       (2) If the KeyName does not exist and the KeyFile does exist, the key
//           in the KeyFile is installed into the CSP and used.
//   (*) In order to create a KeyFile, you can use the sn.exe (Strong Name) utility.
//        When specifying the KeyFile, the location of the KeyFile should be
//        relative to the project directory.
//   (*) Delay Signing is an advanced option - see the Microsoft CLR Framework
//       documentation for more information on this.
