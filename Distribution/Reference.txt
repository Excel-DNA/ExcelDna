ExcelDna Reference
==================


Data type marshaling
====================

The allowed function parameter and return types are:
Double
String
DateTime    -- returns a double to Excel (maybe string is better to return?)
Double[]    -- if only one column is passed in, takes that column, else first row is taken
Double[,]
Object
Object[]    -- if only one column is passed in, takes that column, else first row is taken
Object[,]
Boolean (bool) -- returns an Excel bool (maybe string is better to return to Excel?)
Int32 (int)
Int16 (short)
UInt16 (ushort)
Decimal

incoming function parameters of type Object will only arrive as one of the following:
Double
String
Boolean
ExcelDna.Integration.ExcelError
System.Reflection.Missing.Value
null (from empty cell)
Object[,] containing an array with a mixture of the above types
ExcelReference -- (Only if AllowReference=true in ExcelArgumentAttribute causing R type instead of P)

function parameters of type Object[] or Object[,] will receive an array containing a mixture of the above types (excluding Object[,])

return values of type Object are allowed to be:
Double
String
DateTime
Boolean
Double[]
Double[,]
Object[]
Object[,]
ExcelDna.Integration.ExcelError
Int32 (int)
Int16 (short)
UInt16 (ushort)
Decimal
null reference returns #NUM! error
otherwise return #VALUE! error

return values of type Object[] and Object[,] are processed as arrays of the type Object, containing a mixture of the above, excluding the array types.


Public types in ExcelDna library
================================
Intended for use within user code (all in the namepace ExcelDna.Integration) are the following:

Attributes 
----------
ExcelFunctionAttribute - for user-defined functions
	Name
	Description
	Category (by default the name of the add-in)
	HelpTopic
	IsVolatile (! suffix)
	IsMacroType (# suffix)
ExcelArgumentAttribute - for the arguments of user-defined functions
	Name
	Description
	AllowReference (R type) - Arguments of type object may receive ExcelReference.
ExcelCommandAttribute - for macro commands
	Name
	Description
	HelpTopic
	ShortCut
	MenuName (default is library name)
	MenuText
	IsHidden

Helper classes
--------------
ExcelReference - contains a sheet reference. Get/SetValue to read/write to the cells.
ExcelError - an enum listing the different Excel errors
ExcelDnaUtils - contains Application property (for COM access), WindowHandle and IsInFunctionWizard.

Wrapper for the Excel 97 SDK API
--------------------------------
XlCall class
XlCall.Excel wraps Excel4/Excel12 (but easy to call), also constants for all the API functions and commands.

XlCallException - is thrown when the call to Excel fails.
XlCall.TryExcel - does not throw exception on fail, but returns an XlCallReturn enum value.
ExcelDna.Integration.Integration contains the static method 'RegisterMethods' which allow dynamic registration of methods.

Excel COM interface access
==========================
ExcelDna.Integration.ExcelDnaUtils.Application returns the Excel Application COM object.
From VB this can be used late-bound quite easily.

Default references and imports
==============================
A reference to the ExcelDna.Integration assembly in the .xll file that is 
loading a .dna file is always added when the .dna file is compiled.

In addition, the following references are added to each project, unless a DefaultReferences="false" attribute is set on the <Project>:
System.dll
System.Data.dll
System.Xml.dll

For VB projects, the following imports are added, unless a DefaultImports="false" attribute is set on the <Project>:
Microsoft.VisualBasic
System
System.Collections
System.Collections.Generic
System.Data
System.Diagnostics
ExcelDna.Integration


.dna file schema
================
DnaLibrary 
	Name
	Description

AutoOpen/AutoClose
==================
Cleanup is only done when the add-in is removed from the add-in manager.
