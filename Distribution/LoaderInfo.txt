We determine the list of CLR versions that are installed.
If there is no CLR installed, or the largest version is < v2, we display a message and do not load the add-in.
If the latest version of the CLR is >= v2 we check whether a CLR is loaded in the Excel process.
If a CLR is loaded, we determine the version.
If version loaded is < v2, then we display a message describing the problem, and exit without loading the CLR.
If a version of the CLR is loaded > v2, we load the add-in.
If no version of the CLR is loaded, we load the latest version of the CLR. This should be consistent with the documented behaviour of Excel 2007.
(In future we might allow for the loading to be customised.)

Q: Is DLLMain called earlier than AutoLoad?
Yes.

TODO:
Add-In loader messages should be lifted out of code into resources, should have name of add-in added.


Reasons for implementing the new loader:
- Explicit messages if the .Net runtime is not installed, or if wrong version will be loaded.
- Control over the loading of the AppDomains and code into the AppDomains.
- no VCRT dependency - thus no IJW

I use the deprecated ICorRuntimeHost since I can not assume complete control over CLR hosting, 
and need access to the AppDomain in order to load and run the code I want.

Load Contexts!!!


===========================
ExcelDna.xll
	- unmanaged shim
ExcelDna.Loader
	- loaded by the unmanaged shim as the transition to managed code
	- unsafe code
	- marshaling
	- methodinfo -> functionptr
	- may load ExcelDna.Integration is loaded, but all references are late-bound
	- contains AssemblyManager
	- marshal returns types from ExcelDna.Integration
	- no code (except unmanaged shim) should try to load or reference ExcelDna.Loader.
ExcelDna.Integration
	- everything users would reference
	- is given any info or methods needed from ExcelDna.Loader as delegates passed
		in during initialize
	- does not load or reference ExcelDna.Loader, early or late-bound
	- in principle is designed to be swapped out with a lighter or heavier integration layer
	  interface is controlled - a bit like clr hosting
